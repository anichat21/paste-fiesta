foreign [Music] hello everyone and welcome back to UE lfg where we find a party to share what they've learned from game making I'm your host Tina and today with me I have the developers of shoulders of giants here they're going to be going over their incredible game and some of the pros and maybe occasional pitfalls of development the the journey along the way but mostly only good things I'm sure so to kick us off how about we learn a little bit about our guests for today so Kyle do you want to tell us just a little bit about yourself sure hi I'm Kyle I am the technical director at moving pieces interactive so I'm sort of the lead programmer but we're also a small Indie studio so I had a lot of other hats working on story ability design combat things like that uh and then outside of games my background was working in bigger tech companies and I'm also a comedy writer based here in Brooklyn written for TV books and helped start hard drive the internet's only video game comedy thing um let's pass it to Pat what about you man hey how's it going everybody um my name is Patrick I am the President of moving pieces interactive which as Kyle said is a small very small Indie Studio based in Brooklyn New York um my role is a lot of different things I'm pretty much the primary 3D artist look development artist sound designer level designer so I have my hands in a lot of different aspects of the project before starting moving pieces I worked as a 3D and visual effects artist working in the advertising industry for about a decade and then switched over to games um and started moving pieces in 2019. that's awesome so yeah between the two of you you do have a lot of hats and I love that phrase because it makes me just think of an actual like literal wall with just a bunch of tiny different hats along it um but anyway that aside I'm working from home today I would show you the hats but unfortunately none at home we do have them we do have all the hats but yeah it would it would clog up our webcams for security purposes we cannot dive further into the hats today so so for anyone who's unfamiliar with the game do either one of you want to give us just kind of a quick synopsis overview of what it is we're going to be looking at or Pat do you want to take this sure yeah so shoulders of giants is a 3D action adventure game um it's a roguelike where you simultaneously control two characters at once one is a powerful uh sword wielding Mech pushed to top his shoulders is a sharp shooting space frog you scavenge for an arsenal of abilities and you use them to restore light to the universe it's also it's single player and also up to four player online co-op awesome well I'm very excited to dive in I have a whole list of questions prepared because I think the game is amazing and adorable and so much fun and I want to get everyone all hyped about it too so if you're up for it I'm ready to uh to Dive Right In let's do it great all right we've already got a game prepared out of the oven here yeah there we go we've got it pulled up yep oh this is shoulders of giants our cool 3D cartoon sci-fi gameplay sandbox [Laughter] with the spin we can start us off we can high five of each other yeah definitely so the first thing people usually notice when playing the game is the character is it's two characters um and in our case I guess it's four because we are in a networked multiplayer but you are both controlling this big Mech as Patrick stated right now he has this uh energy sword equipped and then with the click of a button it becomes a tactical third person shooter where you control froggy uh a space frog destined to save the universe and uh a big part of the game is each each character has their own set of abilities so right now in the hub world we just each character has one but as we go out on missions there's over I believe we have over 70 different abilities now you can acquire and pick up and uh so basically like the idea is every run you have your play style is going to like drastically change based on the abilities that you have equipped oh yeah it's um spam in there um if Pat were an enemy he would have stepped on that rake and it would have hit him in the face but unfortunately he's a friend brakes can be very dangerous yeah we try to do kind of a fun just like humorous take on like what like a Sci-Fi ability could be so they range from rakes we have RC cars we have missile turrets we have like a pretty wide array of different things we have a big shoe uh you can hit guys with shoe sticky grenades [Laughter] those are all incredible abilities that I feel like you wouldn't really get to see together in most circumstances so I guess to start us off I have a question about just kind of your inspiration behind the game because as we can already see there's a lot of kind of fun silly aspects to it the art style is very bright and colorful um so I'd love to hear a little bit more about just kind of what what started the thought process behind it sure I can I can kick it off here and just say like the the very first like as we finished our last project um and we were starting to come up with ideas for our next game some reason we were just really enamored by this idea of having like this like silhouette of like juxtaposing like a big character with a small character on top and that was like the main that was like the thing that kind of like has stayed true throughout the development process one of the only things um the game went through like a lot of different iterations like we actually started off experimenting with it as like an RTS and then it moved into like the roguelike that it is now um but yeah Kyle what what what are a couple games that you would say would like inspired like the the gameplay it takes a lot from everything uh we've ever played but I mean the biggest things are are other sort of action RPGs and roguelikes like risk of rain and Diablo and then of course a lot of the actual second to Second gameplay is very similar to something maybe like Ratchet and Clank uh there's a lot of visuals taken from like buddy Platformers of the early OTS I mean that's kind of like the gimmick right is like you're a small guy on a big guy so um you know just you could list those all day with Banjo Kazooie yeah I can do extra that kind of thing and just like taking all these things we love from gaming and really just trying to take that into a modern context with the sort of roguelike 3D exploration going on and I will say like from my perspective is like kind of like the 3D artist like my background was always like making like these like Photo real projects so I really got excited about making a project that it was more of like a stylized kind of like comic book kind of vibe and that kind of helped push us in the direction of like the way the game looks as well definitely yeah do something a little different shake things up like a a passion project to start with or was this trying to think of how to phrase it it's more because obviously there's a lot of tiny things um was it just like this sounds fun let's do it I think it was like so our last game um and our first commercial release project is a studio um DOTA Peak was a lot smaller in scope so we you know we did what like everyone tells you not to do which is like make more of your like dream game which is like way bigger in scope like this is a much bigger project than our than our first one it's got like you know networked multiplayer it's like full 3d you know third person action um so it was very much so like we were you know wanted to do we we wanted this game to kind of incorporate all the things that we were like really into like I was I think really excited about making like a game with like story elements I was like really in love with just like I've always loved space and like science fiction art and so we kind of like merged all those together and kind of you know ultimately made the game that we really wanted to play as well yeah I can make that answer even longer um I think in terms of like how we development have developed this like Patrick alluded to earlier we didn't set out really to make a roguelike action game um we sort of started with a very naive and fun but also I wouldn't recommend it form of development of just kind of like see what's fun and like go in completely without a plan like we really just knew we wanted a big character with a small character on top uh and the game started as this like sort of death stranding like move for me to be like sneak around and collect orbs to power up this big Mech and then smash everybody and it became an RTS and then we were like it's only fun when you're on the robots so now that's just the game is only when you're on the robots and then like this game could have been made a year faster I think if we had like known going in we wanted to make a roguelike multiplayer game uh but instead it was very improvisational it was a lot of like yes and adding on and so the upside of that is I don't really there's almost no ideas in the game where we can say like oh this was like Patrick's idea or like this was like a plan like it just kind of came together yeah it was a very collaborative process and I will say like one thing that also has stuck throughout the project is like one of the big themes of like the characters like spreading light so like we were into the idea like mechanically like what how would you like it's red like lights or like restore worlds and a sense of like to feel like your progress um so that mechanic was like something that originally was in the game and we first very first started prototyping it back in the days when it was in RTS and it stayed um now so you can see we basically destroyed what we call like an entropy spire and that has basically restored this area this uh light and light back to it so as we um take out those next Parts purple yeah and a lot of the abilities and stuff you have in the game too will also spread light yeah it's a really I'd love to talk more about the system technically in a bit but um the light thing is it's very cool it's all real time uh a really I think it's gorgeous uh you'll get a big blast of it whenever we beat a level but uh with one thing I do think it's very funny from a developer's perspective is like game developers think this is like very cool uh because it's really hard to have like the trees like come to life and all the meshes change as like the light expands uh people who just play games are like less impressed by it other than it just looks nice because they're just like oh of course it does that um so like you post a picture of that transition it'll go to the top of like our Game Dev but like if you show it to normal uh civilians they're just like yeah that's neat [Music] that's cool and it is cool yeah I I'm kind of curious if there's anything else in the game we feel it's kind of like that where Maybe you feel like it's more appreciated by other developers than just players um I know a running theme for all of these for anyone who has multiplayers to say multiplayer and it's multiplayer every game developer who makes a multiplayer game is on a quest to convince people that it's hard to make a multiplayer game over the Internet yeah that's definitely something yeah they don't I think I understand the nuances of it quite as much but they I think they definitely appreciate it when it works yeah oh certainly well I feel like I may partially already have the answer to this question considering how you you said the development was kind of improvised as it went along but would you say that there were any major changes in the game from where it started to how it is now yeah for sure yeah like pretty much everything but I think like the genre change from like RTS to like roguelike was like definitely um like the biggest shift um and I think Kyle mentioned this earlier too but initially you were able we kind of like treated like the robot as more of like an AI companion um and we've prototyped that a lot but then we were like okay well what I feel like the two characters are like fixed together and you can't like dismount the robot and like run separately and that ended up just kind of simplifying the gameplay and I'm in a in a good way and that was like another big change that we made that um I think changed the game for the better hmm I'm sorry I'm so mesmerized by absolutely everything a lot going on the screen right now there's fireworks there's an explosions shoulders of giants and like the gameplay Loop is really meant to feel and like maybe uh some of our listeners were better at having friends than me but it to me I want it to be like when you're a kid you're at recess and you're just like playing make believe and you're like oh now I'm gonna do this so now I do this and now I like throw these and like oh now it's now I'm a tornado I'm a freaking tornado um I I attached a electrical cord to my friend and now I'm gonna like run around uh it's it's meant to have that feeling of just like constant improvisation and motion um and as many things as I am I always wishing we could do better I do feel like we could accomplish that which I'm very proud of yeah I think so too and like I mentioned earlier like we wanted to have a game oh like you know obviously it's a roguelike but we wanted every run to really feel different in the sense of like how you play it like your play style your abilities and I think like one of the things we've we've been updating the game quite a bit since it came out and one of the things that we find that's like always really valuable to add is adding more abilities because it just adds to the breadth of things that you can do and kind of the like the toy box that you can have in the game just kind of expands which I think ultimately just makes the game better and like our original Edition for it hmm oh oh no oh you can see right now oh I'm surfing on a rainbow light rail which is one of the more recent abilities we added yeah so an update I should say two things uh an update for this game came out like yesterday so we just added uh 12 new abilities a bunch of new enemies uh a lot of cool new overhauls like the game's still very much in active development despite being out for like seven months um not that it wasn't done when we released it but we just love adding more um and so yeah one of those that is was usually my favorite thing I've probably ever made which is this thing that lets you turn every level into Tony Hawk's Pro Skater I have that ability I thought you had it that's crazy jump of it and drop bombs and then I can have a big flap of my hands so they're all they're all all the abilities are pretty silly and fun [Laughter] I just I really do love the almost juxtaposition I guess of how serious some of these enemies look I mean you have these sci-fi Mages and you know some really intense feeling enemies and yeah then you're skateboarding on Rainbow reels and throwing ranks at people very unique vibe that you've managed to cultivate thank you um um a lot of reviews which is this is an interesting thing about making I guess art um is uh a lot of the reviews were like this game has a lot of like really nails like early 2000s like wackiness um and that was never one of the pillars of art of us making the game I think that's just like me being raged by television like watching like Nickelodeon cartoons all day um it's very interesting to hear someone like unpack your whole deal uh without you knowing it yeah it's always really cool to just like you know when you get the first like reactions like what you know what people think and their interpretation of what you've made there's an interest it should be the last level in this Mission sorry uh go ahead sorry oh no definitely I um it was just since we were just talking about the light rails they're wondering if those are predetermined locations or if you actually um select where they go they are totally Dynamic and it's the hardest it's probably I'm really proud of it this is I've never Rewritten any system as much as these it was very much a passion project it was not a good use of time um but I I've I've always loved in so we we look to like a lot of like other sort of action Platformers for inspiration and all of them kind of have like these like rails you can grinds and I was like that would be cool but um it's hard to do with these dynamic levels to begin with and like they're usually very passive like ways to break up levels they're not like things you can just make happen so my goal was to make it so you could make the rail um and yeah we end up doing a thing where we you just kind of try and figure out what you would do as a person laying it out and then try and make the computer do that so a little bit of the secret sauce is it uses the navigation mesh and we'll try and like move you towards something interesting and like it picks something in the direction you're facing tries to take you to that like end point with a rail and then it also has some like built-in waviness and tries to avoid obstacles and um it's not super complicated but it it does work I've never seen anyone else do it I'm sure someone in chat can tell me some other game already did it but I'm very proud of it if you couldn't tell one thing I will add is as Kyle like our kind of workflow is like Kyle will like prototype the abilities and then once we're happy with it I'll take it over and I'll like you know kind of figure out how it's gonna look and like you know add sounds and kind of like polish it up so when he gave me the the uh the rail ability I was like this is super cool um but like I think the expectation for a rail like in like Tony Hawk is like it's very smooth and there's like a lot of polygons there's a lot of segments but like using this method we knew that that would be like really expensive so the idea was like okay let's make it more of a just like very abstract organic shape like let's make it like rainbow road from like Mario Kart and that was kind of we like put the rainbow Shader on there they were like okay this is this works this is pretty cool I love the combat in this so much thank you I'm putting down a like bubble that slows time um which is something that's generally like very dangerous to do in multiplayer games um shout out to again like I love just playing other games and seeing what other people are doing I know uh outriders I was playing that just for like reference about some UI stuff and I realized like half of their abilities like slow time in multiplayer and that then I was just like oh maybe it's possible and it is um so shout out to them not enough people played out Riders that's my two cents oh my gosh that's just so much fun I'm curious about some of the design process behind the enemies um I don't know if there's any particular Insight you can give in on those they're just so typically I'll eat a large meal and go to sleep and then my nightmares now the I actually probably the thing I'd be the worst at describing I'm not really sure how we did this um yeah like so our we have a Concepts artist um his name is uh Max and he actually was worked with us on our first first game too and um you know I think like we were we were into this like as you can tell a lot of the art style is like it's kind of this like sci-fi like dystopian kind of vibe um mixed with like Ancient Aliens and you know some kind of like fun stuff like that so I think that was like for the most part like a lot of the inspiration behind some of the enemies um but we also wanted to like take Inspirations from like you know uh like Star Fox and kind of like how they like to find their characters and um like that like more like approachable kind of like like friendly cartoon like sci-fi Vibe so kind of mixing all that together I think is where we ended up yeah and yeah I should definitely I didn't mean to ignore Max like Max is a freaking genius uh yeah Maxine Bourgeois on uh we hosted Suites look at our Twitter you'll you'll see him he's amazing um in terms of like what the enemies are and do we honestly would just kind of like have big brainstorming sessions I think is like the short of it we knew we wanted a lot of them um because a lot of the soul of the game is in variety um yeah like really kind of like that is yeah there's only so much we just have to manipulate space and damage and like there's only so many variables so like finding every possible Niche that an enemy can fail it's a lot of fun and a lot of hard work and I think I've abandoned you oh here we are yeah I'm gonna give you a high five we got this last fire over here I think then we're gonna do a boss oh my goodness should I sneak the questions and now before the boss yeah that's a good time [Laughter] so I with the amount of just things the sheer amount of stuff that you developed for this I have to know if there were any memorable bugs that came up along the way yes so I there's one especially hilarious bug which is if you're interested you can go to our Tick Tock and we have a post about it um but so as you can see like Island Eyes characters like we have like what we call like core so it's basically like an armor set that has like a passive ability and as we started developing those and like our first round of creating them we were setting up a system that would like change the mesh and change some of the shaders to accommodate that and one of the byproducts of this is like as you can see as I like go to the Frog view these like shoulders like fade away to like help you like not you know have them not obscure your view so um our Tech artist was making the first one and the Shader that the double duplicated the Shader that makes these shoulders invisible and it accidentally got on the Frog's clothes so when you went to the Frog view the Frog just became like totally naked and uh it was It was kind of amazing I kind of wanted to keep it but we decided you know maybe in a future update we'll we'll add it back then hahaha it's really a special event yeah that was that was that was that was a big one but we also wanted to keep our PG rating too so we didn't want to you know push that much there's the boss um in terms of other bugs I wish there were I can't think of any more like super interesting one I mean that one takes the cake but in terms of like the other ones are like less fun and more maddening uh we've had issues where like or in multiplayer like certain enemies will just like stop replicating the clients and you'll get hit by invisible enemies and like not not excited things like that uh yeah oh my God spider you've been pretty good against it actually you have yeah we did actually pretty good we had it there's also at a low low heat level so it's gonna start to get a little bit harder here oh and I I jumped 100 times Pat I fulfilled that Quest I didn't get new emotes yeah some rewards here okay I got a new weapon we can stop looking the same [Music] oh you got the power tools I did which is the new uh one of the new weapons we just added if you want to try out the power tools for yourself you can check out the game right now on Xbox and the epic game store um like I mentioned before the the update just came out this plug earlier dodo Peak our first game is a free game right now on Epic so definitely like claim that if you're watching this it's free I can't give it to you any easier than that I will find the links for everyone right now there we go links for both shoulders of giant and dodo people in the chat there okay when some just you know getting my gym time in here yeah hold on I'm gonna get a different die there we go this is yeah the Evo system was just kind of something fun we added to the game it's just like silly to do with your friends so I just spent all my money on on Cosmetics unfortunately uh don't you know you're better at games when you have more cosmetics here you're working out too who wanted us to take out so that you could see other players in that menu but um then I couldn't do this and ruin the whole stream I know now I'm curious especially knowing that there's emotes do you have and this is for both of you do you have a favorite animation overall in the game uh I love all of the NPC animations so if you look at the baboon right there just like very uh unsafely twirling her gun around when you come up to her to pack her up here like all the character NPC animations are um very good uh our animator Elizabeth just like when I see this stuff I get kind of teary-eyed just like knowing that we made something that is just like that beautiful and cartoony um I love it I I love the community I love the I love the MPC animations too and I also really like I mean for me personally they're a lot more simple but they're just fun I just I love the a lot of the emo animations like I like this one just I want you guys uh one that requires like a very high level Quest is like t-pose um but it's just like fun and silly like some people we did a video like is this broken yes this is just silly people on the team kept making it so you couldn't move while you were doing it's like no let you move around like I was raised by Team Fortress 2. I need it to work that way and it's so hard to communicate that sometimes when you're in a somewhat leadership position at game you just have to be like trust me all right so this this world has regenerating enemy Health on it so it's going to be a good bit harder um see if we die I might have missed it um do you do you select those kinds of things or is it randomized they are um random like when the uh Kyle can probably speak to this more about how it technically works but like once you start a new um once you beat a level the new worlds are like populated and there's a lot of different like random attributes that are assigned to them yeah so you're choosing you open up the planet selected the telescope and that gives you a list of like three or four if you upgrade it uh planets to choose from but there's planets are randomly generated like one of the attributes they have there'll always be like one that doesn't have any and like we we do things like that this game has a lot of protein it doesn't have any mod I don't think we've yeah we've really talked talked about it I have a question here from chat they're wondering if you utilized the gas system at all for this of course um this game would not be possible without the gameplay ability system um um I'm assuming the person asking that question is somewhat familiar with it uh there are a lot of you know usability things like it takes a lot of time to learn but for multiplayer having a a product like that that has already thought about that sort of thing um it's so helpful um if they have any specific questions I'm happy to answer like details on that but yeah everything all the abilities are gameplay abilities uh I think basically everything you do except for possibly jump is like routed through the gameplay ability system in some way for those who don't know the gameplay ability system is a way of like managing it does like 12 things it's a very hard thing to describes succinctly but it helps you manage the state of player actions and game state in a multiplayer context if it sounds boring and kind of computer wonky like it is it is like not an exciting thing to learn about if you're not making a game but so the the one thing I'll point out is like okay you're making a game like like this one or you're making a game called like wizard battle and you know Wizards have spells they can cast um and so you can charge up like a fireball spell and it takes two seconds to charge and you play an animation and it fires and you realize really quickly like what felt like a just a set of things to do becomes like an infinitely manipulable set of like state so like what if someone has a spell that like stops you from casting your spell well now you have to add all these hooks in your code to like stop charging the cell like stop the animation and um before we had the gameplay ability system that was just immediately became unmanageable um like we'd have like a hundred different events just for like stop charging stops done like enable stun like quit timeline and having it all be based in this sort of like object-oriented system uh but again for those who don't know this was used uh this is used in fortnite um it was developed uh for that cool mocha game that I'm forgetting the name of right now Epic Paragon yeah uh I'm gonna die Pat talk too much about talking too much that's why I'm kidding but yeah I like gameplay abilities is uh being killed for knowing it huh it's like Fight Club from my perspective um gameplay abilities I was I'm a little more of a Kyle's much more of a programmer than I am so I'm a little like more messy um a little more spaghetti with the blueprints so having the gameplay ability system definitely helps out like keeping things like a lot more organized yes having every um we have to kill this thing I have to give a really complicated technical explanation I feel like I'm joining a fraternity um so yeah having every all your gameplay system or like all your gameplay code be in its own object where it like can't become this giant blueprint spaghetti mess interacting with like 12 other abilities um it's really helpful even if like you don't really understand why Kyle is telling you you have to write abilities this way now like it probably took me two months to understand gas and then probably took us as a team like a whole year to really get it God I'm gonna live I'm gonna do this for you buddy you got it you're gonna get the health oh you can get reborn where is there it is there it is there it is oh that's perfect so you should um you should explain that ability because I think it's really cool so speaking of gas this is really cool you start to learn how to like think in the gameplay ability system Paradigm and things that you thought were just gonna be so impossible to do with it are actually very easy so like we're able to do much crazier abilities in our updates just because we're better at making games now um so like like I mentioned before manipulating time is very hard and uh oh these guys are healing crap this is the worst level to explain stuff on uh manipulating is really hard in multiplayer um uh but we added a thing where you can like do an action and then like go back in time it looks cooler when you're not a spectator but you can like take damage you can rewind it you can like use an ability rewind it so I'll go do that down here I'll like just fire off all these abilities rewinds and now I have them again and that like Works in multiplayer um and you do it with some cool things like basically just keeping a track of all your state and another ability that just runs and you read from it um I won't go into all the technical details uh because I'm bad at explaining them and not because they're especially complicated [Laughter] you're also solo right now because I died I'm outside right now that's the problem that's what happens you should start a a gameplay ability system death count for this stream I mean I guess oh yeah this is the final okay I'll get you back buddy give me back I believe I can't believe you lived through that fight you had like a sliver of Health left so we do do some secret things and I'll talk about this because it's a game stream and not like a marketing screen stream like it's a Game Dev stream um we do have some things that make it like a little harder to die than it might seem it's still a very easy game to be killed in like it's people a lot of people do think it's very hard um but you know we we have protection that a lot of games have where it's like oh if something does you know half your health in one hit like it can't kill you you'll be stuck with one Health and like you have iframes after getting hit so if you like really learn that stuff you can be much riskier um or you can explain a niche and play plugin while playing the game there we go some push-ups when it like goes out assert dominance through push-ups yeah um was that a choice because the game you found was just harder than you were intending it to be or did you always intend for there to be kind of rules like that around some of these abilities uh uh are you talking about the like the like the health forgiveness and like the iframes yes yeah I think like I think that's something that we kind of always expected to have just because it's like you know it's like I feel like people love like there's like in the difficulty balance it's like people want to get like really close to the edge sometimes they want to go over it but sometimes they don't so like kind of like those are the kind of tools I think that you could have as like a game developer in a game like this that allows you to like get people close but not always like throw them overboard you know what I mean and like prevent some frustration but also keep the adrenaline going getting them I think and I'm sure people have said people have said this another episode they've listened to of this broadcast um your your role developing a game is not to necessarily make something that is fair or make sense to show people a good time and when people feel like they just barely squeaked out of something they're gonna enjoy it more than if they like died when they thought they shouldn't or like didn't overcome something so we want to make things tough but we don't want to make it like we want to make it so you err on the side of like I have crium um like that's that's a big part of it at least for me and also iframes and stuff people do just expect that to be there and it feels wrong if it's not um we could actually talk a lot about like expectation driven developments uh in terms of like what we added to the game because of people were like why isn't this in the game yeah we initially didn't have the iframe system um and then people are like oh yeah like I kind of expected to have like you know when I'm doing an attack to not be able to be hit we're like oh actually that makes a lot of sense we should we should work on it we are even bigger we didn't have a jump button um we didn't you weren't able to jump and you weren't able to Sprint and we learned very quickly that those were absolutely things that people would not and Sprint from a gameplay perspective at the time it makes sense to add because he sometimes had to walk too long our early levels had no reason to jump I want to make that clear there was nothing to jump on or over or yeah so but we just like we added the jump and we were like able to jump yeah why did we not have a jump in in the beginning and then obviously that informed like our level design and like yeah it was definitely an improvement and then of course by adding I just triggered the Boss by adding the jump we could add jump attacks and all this other stuff so it was a very worthy thing to do and our levels got better for it but like even if there was no reason to jump my ears will still tell you you're wrong to not have it [Music] they want the power to jump a reason to jump exactly oh God through generating Gotta Get The High Ground oh my God I'm running away I need to get some health here oh shoot oh I just got hit I'm running away I'm sorry I believe in you and your four health oh my God I got it okay you got him nice work nicely done let's go gamers Pro Gamers right here it's going in the chat um speaking of chat there's a couple questions I should I should catch up on here just my own um so there's a question here from skills they're wondering can you tell us a bit about the networking choices made for the game like are you using EOS server setup latency issues or enhancements Etc I suppose I'll feel that um that's a great question and I should have plugged it earlier we are on Epic online services so we are cross play um which is amazing um it's that it's kind of like magic like once you get all the configuration set up it just kind of works which I'm still astounded by um it's so rare in computers for that to be true uh the game uses a peer-to-peer model um we're a very small team like very small like our we have three full-time employees and one part-time employee like we don't I don't want to run dedicated servers I know there's lots of things to help you do that but I've I left I left a lot of uh on-call jobs and I'm not eager to get back to it I would much rather have every player be a server and then that's just free Hardware um right so we're peer-to-peer like right now we're on Patrick's machine and I'm just like talking to it but EOS makes that very very easy um the setup uh in terms of like optimizations we did that is a much like uh let me open let me change my weapon really quick uh in terms of optimizations we did uh in terms of networking optimizations there is a lot more like client authoritative stuff than it's on by default and unreal so like because we have so many abilities that move the player around it's just like if the characters within like 500 units or something of what it's supposed to be on the server everyone's just like it's fine don't correct it um because normally with the server authoritative model It'll like try and force you to where you're supposed to be and so and um I will say like some of those you know the documentation could be more aggressive about telling you they exist but uh once you figure it out it's like very very easy to set up um other network optimizations um network was honestly not like a huge problem for us uh most of our optimizations are more like gameplay um and getting like a bunch of enemies running at once right yeah networking is actually was never really a bottleneck for us thankfully aside from like all these weird correction issues you check me out I look so cool yeah you have one of our newest this is a newest course that we added other questions that popped up here was um to go back to gas for just a second and someone's gonna doubt what I love to talk about gameplay ability system and not get like shoved into a locker afterwards this is great well there's no problem I'm back is wondering what is the best way in your opinion to practice the gameplay ability system while you're just kind of getting used to it um my sound effects are going crazy right now so let me repeat the question it's like what's the best way to get practice with gameplay abilities yeah I think what what would be your advice on trying to learn it learn it um I mean obviously the short answer is like you gotta make a game with it man you gotta you gotta make make something with like a multiplayer that you can mess with but in terms of learning it um yeah there's there's more now than there were when I started there is a extremely important GitHub page that has like a project and like the best documentation of like anything I've like ever used um like not just compared to Unreal docs but like just anything it's very good um so like it's called like gas project or something you'll find it it's it's everywhere um there is an unreal I think there might be like newer stuff that has this but there's an unreal sample project that's called like action RPG um I don't actually think it's that useful because it's single player only and you don't really learn the multiplayer Parts which to me is like that's the magic of gas um so there's that there's a few talks um there's a very very very responsive and helpful uh Discord uh room in the unreal Slackers that you have to join um that's kind of the mate like that's I don't usually say that about Discord uh chat rooms for like technical advice but like it's so good everyone's so helpful um that would kind of be it and you just gotta like fry it and design things really badly the first time and then realize what you're actually doing yeah um I was also kind of learning unreal's multiplayer model while learning gas which if you can avoid that I would recommend like learn make like a multiplayer game and unreal first and then try and do something with gas like learn about what an RPC is and things like that right and also just like I don't know you can Twitter is a weird dying website you can ping me on there if you have a specific question [Laughter] formerly known as Twitter yeah my apologies I apologies but yeah gas is great it's really hard to learn um if you can learn it it's great it's it's good uh job security like if you want a job it's a really good way to get a job probably um a lot of students because it is it's super powerful it's so good it's just so complicated and there's also like with gas there's at least four or five ways to do any given thing and these two of those are probably good so it can be kind of a rough thing to coordinate a team on that would be my like one thing to look out for there's just so many different ways to solve problems using the systems it gives you usually with uh engineering design stuff it's really good if there's only one good way to do something because then no one has to like argue about it but it's a very good powerful thing from it's tomato but there's numbers in the middle so I know I'm gonna mess it up so I'm just gonna say two minutes how do you decide what's part of an ability like are most abilities instant or our most abilities active and the only end until a certain gameplay event happened I love that these are very specific technical questions I actually wasn't expecting that um there are almost all just instance per execution most of the chat will probably I feel like I'm speaking this gibberish they're instance pure execution um we replicate all of our projectiles they're just replicated actors we don't do anything cool and predictive there uh if I start over maybe I would but they're generally good enough if your paying is under 100. so when I shoot like it I I don't see a bullet on my screen until a Patrick's computer says I can uh and it feels totally fine to me right now um playing across the world maybe you'd notice a little bit of lag there um so it's literally just like we we send targeting data from the client to the server when an ability starts with like the weight Target thing uh usually I have a custom Target actor weight thing that will like send um uh just like where you're looking and it uses that to spawn a projectile and then everything else we usually take off a the activate abilities uh manually I just tag if that's something they're curious about like we every ability has its own slot you couldn't use the input system I don't think because you can have multiple copies of an ability that each have their own cooldowns so we have a custom cooldown effect I'm just dumping every possible thing you might want to know because I'm not totally sure what they want to know specifically I have a question for you what's up how does the how does the remote controlled car ability work I always I always was fast food hold on hold on hold on stop moving stop moving let it hit you hold on okay okay drive oh yeah you can write on it too yeah so the best thing about making games is you can put whatever you want in them so like you can make a little remote control car that you ride around on top of and can go up walls um the way it works is actually again this is way too complicated for what it is um it tries it the owner of the car is constantly telling the server where the car should try and go and then the car tries to go there with like a series of four or five different line traces from different angles so it can like handle corners and stuff um Pat like look at me never mind so the bot like the car can go up walls and stuff I can go up trees you can't see that we have more important things to do we got this one I'd like to say all of our bosses are the same amount of difficulty but this is definitely one of the more manageable ones a lot of people compare this boss to a big chicken which I I can see yeah that's it yeah it's chicken those chicken with the helmet I thought it was a crown what is a crown it's a very cool purple crown called out in front of all these people I was I love this color I said I love this all this pink so all of the worlds have like Dynamic like we have different we can change these colors basically at run time um they're not baked into the assets um they're all reading from a material collection so it's very easy for us to like make a new kind of color something can be [Music] I'd be interesting to somebody I don't know it's absolutely ooh gold cores well let's see what we got here oh the nature core I think this one's my favorite NPC that we've seen thus far the panda so yeah so friendly just like a big teddy bear I love the panda and that's part of the reason we stuck with um the player the animal names it's a very fairy tale like that's Panda there's baboon there's owl there's Dr chameleon it's very storybook um and it's very archetypal so people can kind of understand how these characters are just from the animations and what kind of animal they are which is really nice narrative shortcut the game story is not especially deep there are a few cutscenes we might see one in a bit um but mostly it's just incidental like character dialogue try and look cool here we tried to make the characters just like a fun cartoon world to hang out in I definitely definitely have another question from not The Tech Guy here who's wondering as a game gets more and more challenging players will often lean further and further into range attacks or to avoid damage so how do you incentivize the player to keep mixing up attacks even on higher difficulties we we introduced a uh like at the beginning of development we it's interesting because we were very cognizant of like the balance between the germ like the frog and the robot so the robot's name is germ um because we we knew like we wanted to make a game where like ideally people would use both because that's where we felt like the game was its strongest so originally we definitely noticed that people were like leaning back a little bit more um and doing like more ranged attacks so we introduced like a Reload mechanic as you see like when I empty my clip I have to reload and that actually helped like significantly in um helping like people balanced and wanting to use the robot more uh the other thing we did was what we were talking about earlier is we added like iframes to the melee combat so like as I go through like different you know melee attacks there's portions of them were like I'm invincible and I can't be hit um and those those are like the two I think most powerful things that we did and then we like we tested the game more after we added those things and we noticed that some people which is ideally what we wanted some people were like oh I find myself like using the robot a lot more I'm not using the Frog as much or like vice versa when we heard that feedback from like the majority of people we knew that like at least we felt like the game was like pretty balanced and like some players are gonna kind of have like a favorite you know or some players are going to use both but as long as we like felt like we were doing a good job at like balancing them both and giving the player the opportunity to like engage with both of them in like a balanced way we felt like you're in a good spot yeah I can I can add on a little more to that a lot of it is like also just enemy design so there's actually one in this level right now they're they're called the scared sniper um you'll see them they're these little sort of like Hedgehog guys with sniper rifles uh and their whole thing is to keep distance from you and they have a uh Shield so you can't actually shoot them and they're like yeah that's a good point yeah a lot of the enemies like that yeah exactly where like you can't uh even hit them with range necessarily um we also incentivize it with a few of the abilities like really a lot of the ranged abilities are more like status and like crowd control so you have an incentive to like oh I'm going to swap to like my gun and then like stun this thing and then hit it your melee abilities are basically always going to have higher DPS um so you are incentivized also just through that um we have some abilities that were like if you do range damage it'll boost your melee attacks and vice versa so it's really high levels talking about so like if I run away from it you'll see uh it should pop up a shield I don't know why it's not right now oh yeah don't look at that um but anyway that's a shield uh so you have to get up and you have to get close and like ideally melee and check them out later game we also have like enemies that help protect each other so like there's another one that'll just cast a big barrier um but yeah it's that's kind of the big game design question and like it's interesting we have gone to a place where they can play taste play testing uh players would be like wow why would you ever use ranked weapons and some people would be like why would you ever use melee weapons which isn't like the best position to be in but it does like show that there is versatility and like Pat mentioned that's kind of we've we've gotten less of that feedback over time as well just want to point out this is like in my opinion one of the coolest new abilities that we added it's called health bar hacker so you can see all like all the enemies have you know health bars as they take damage so I can hack them and then set the enemy's health bars uh to attack them and they just like smash into the enemy um which I think I don't know how you did that Kyle but it's pretty fun oh it's just a widget animation um but it is uh very inspired by when I was a kid playing like Mario on the NES and you could like go up and be like in the stats um like that whole ability happened because I was like you should be able to like get into the UI and like hit enemies with the UI it started I was like oh it's gonna like pass like like rectangles backwards and you can like use the UI to like hit animes and like that's crazy like with multiplayer that's just too much um and then everyone else I was talking like uh Julia one of our employees like was like you should just get hit with it I was like oh yeah um there's that early 2000s cartoon zaniness I apparently have it's definitely it it feels like it feels cartoonish like you're saying it really leans into that sort of um I wouldn't expect that to be an ability of watching somebody's health bar just turn and oh yeah hit them I mean decoy let me throw this down pat oh yeah I love this one oh you can like enemies will attack that flossy frog we're very hip and know what the kids are up to so yeah oh wait you asked earlier about the animations I Elizabeth their animator I think she did a really good flossing animation so definitely like that it's phenomenal I think this is my favorite color that you've had thus far I am biased because my favorite color but purple's mine so I'm also a big fan I like purple I like it was this world fortified I am not paying attention oh yeah it is so what does fortified do in this sense uh so yeah there's just like these eyeballs they're kind of like turrets that like the enemies of place that have a good amount of health and just can kind of shoot you all over the place um and then like when we have like a more challenging um world like it'll like juice up your rewards and you'll you'll get some like more interesting rewards after you beat it this is cool right now I've got the decoy stuck to an enemy and so the other enemies are like trying to kill it um oh nice poor guy the question that we got in from chat here is they're wondering how long it took you to develop the game and what version of the engine you ended up shipping on yeah so we started developing back like we first kind of like had the idea for the project back in March of 2020. um for a while it was just kind of like me full time and then Kyle was still like doing some stuff for DOTA Peaks it was kind of like on and off um check it out right now in the epic game store for free so yeah go ahead um and then like we ramped up like the team and like started like production like actual production I guess you could call like 2020 it's like pre-production then 2021 it was production and then up until January of this year so I guess that was like how long was that like for almost three years or something like right I've lost track it was it was pretty much exactly three years which is not a huge amount of time in game development but it felt like a while um and then we ended up shipping our current version of the engine we're using is 427. yeah we're trying to get to five um they're just a couple a couple things that we're missing until 5-2 so we had the delay um some of like our stuff with foliage was gonna require too many workarounds um but now five two should work we have like a a rough version on like moved on to five um but it was just too much to get into our most recent update um it looks really nice it's on the road map it looks it looks great I really wish we were on five um also you gotta upgrade if you want it for a multiplayer game that you keep developing like you kind of gotta keep updating to keep being able to use the most recent like multiplayer sdks console sdks like it's got some bugs are kind of out of your control until you get those in um yeah also the UI for the editor is a lot better I really wish we were on five and we're gonna get there soon this is foreign with the updated version um we're not utilizing um nanite because like you know all our assets were kind of optimized for like lods and like less polygons but I started experimenting with Lumen and it it seems like it's pretty cool I think for a game like ours where it's a little more stylized I don't I don't see like as much of a difference with like something that's more photoreal but I'm still like I still think that like we might ship a version of the game with it which should like add some like extra intro like interesting visual entails for sure hmm yeah the new um for me personally what what I noticed them the most I think it's uh PSR it's like been like that's what I was gonna say yeah the like software version of the LSS um that I think for our game it's so good everything is like super sharp it looks like really really nice I mean I know we're on an Unreal Engine stream but it's really it's really good it looks really nice just because you're on Unreal Engine stream does not mean you have to only speak good things about the engine yeah gameplay abilities needs more documentation I feel like I probably made that clear um which I did actually take a note of that of like oh yeah that's some Gucci bags that's uh I think I think the ascent guy said that too uh and also everyone who's used it it's just it's very good it just takes a long time to learn yeah definitely speaking of Unreal Engine since we're on the topic I feel like I'm obligated to ask at least once but um why did you end up choosing to make this game in unreal versus other engines so I will say that the story behind that is essentially like we as a studio we used unreal because we used unreal for our first game so we have like a much more um like in-depth understanding of how it works over something like Unity per se and I initially started working in unreal because my background as a 3D artist I just like opened up like unity and unreal and I just felt like immediately like I understood the UI and like the material editor especially of unreal a lot better than Unity like at that time Unity you could only like you had to like program all your Shooters and stuff and I was like I can't that's not something I can do it's like so um I just felt more drawn to it from like my background and um that's that's kind of the story behind why we initially like chose unreal were there any um uh particular challenges that you've had to kind of work through using the engine and if so do you mind talking about how you did manage to kind of move past those I think yeah I think one of the big ones and Kyle you should pick this up I think because you can go into more depth but like since our game like a lot of the levels like there's they're not like fully procedurally generated but there are a lot of like areas that are turned on and off and things that are moved around so like like the navigation like AI navigation was like a big thing that we had to figure out yeah so like that was that was a that was a big thing we ended up using um a dynamic nav mesh but we like experimented through a ton of different things but cry I'll let you pick it up because I made a lot of the nav mesh and dealing with the nav mesh has been a huge part of this um and I know it pretty pretty good now the dynamic nav mesh is very interesting uh so the navigation match for those who don't know is like you have ai characters that want to be able to like understand the world they live in and how to get from A to B you pre-process a lot of things so that you can know like oh if I'm standing on this like area I can easily move to another area um by going in this like Direction like it's sort of like a a cache of different like triangles that know how to get to the other triangles is the simplest way to put it they might actually be uh Bots I don't know um it does that by like tracing through the level like uh usually you do it when you build the level because arcs can change very very dramatically at runtime um I'm getting killed by Golems one second because I can can change their dynamically at runtime we had to move to like a dynamic nav system uh we tried to avoid that because we wanted this to run potentially on like very low end Hardware at the time um oh like even like an Xbox One you know like yeah yeah it can be really expensive because it's it's pricing it's doing like math to figure out where collisions are through the whole level so it's very expensive it's about the most expensive thing you can do it's like query geometry everywhere um so Dynamic is scary uh we eventually got it working sort of a big Pitfall for anyone who's trying it is I forget the exact variable names um usually when you're a programmer and you want something to be more responsive or like work in smaller steps is you make like the size of work smaller so like oh it needs to create like 100 by 100 cubes around the levels whenever you're moving to figure out like where to recalculate nav mesh um so I had it set to have these like very small things so it could be very responsive and do small amounts of work um for whatever reason because of how the navigation system and unreal is is written and I'm sure there's a fantastic reason for this because I do not know how to do this stuff at all um making the amount of work smaller made it like exponentially slower um so I was like I've made these as small as I reasonably can why isn't it working they're like oh turn it up like I turned it up now the squares are like 16 meters by 16 meters or whatever and they it runs super fast so by making the query size larger it actually made it orders of magnitude faster that would be my biggest like gotcha probably that we hit um the other thing is like managing we have all this Dynamic foliage that we need to turn off because we can turn on and off like huge segments of the level and um the leading foliage and unreal can like get really messy on lower end systems that don't show all the foliage like that's an optimization you can do so if you're making your game that works on Xbox one which is came out like 10 years ago it needs to show 20 of the grass that a Xbox series X can handle and um when you do that with like querying for foliage and then deleting some it will like automatically reshow some of the foliage because now 20 is like a different percentage um so the trick there is to not actually delete fully just to like shrink it and that was something that the support engineer is over at uh unreal development Network very helpful with you oh are you in an arena okay we have these like sectioned off like worlds oh man I wanted to add an indicator okay I think the amount of times y'all have accidentally triggered boss fights because normally you're not maybe we should yeah yeah true I don't think so because there's really nothing else to do unless you're like giving an interview [Laughter] um I will say one thing I wanted to add with the nav mesh situation was like from my perspective as the level designer like one of the most like embarrassing but very easy bugs that people encountered was like of spawning where it shouldn't so like let's say like there were enemies that spawned over a rock or like a piece of like gear that you really wanted um that that happened and did happen like quite a bit yeah um I'd say everyone just played a game where an enemy was in the wall and that sucks yeah so and we know that sucks there's this there's this uh system unreal where you can basically click like fill underneath so that will basically prevent like the nav mesh from getting generated if something is on top of something else um which like helped a lot but um our Tech artist ended up making a tool that would basically like put like little like pointers wherever that was happening which would like help us like identify like those areas and then we could go in and we could like massage things and that's awesome it's really hard to quantify what is this what is a bad place for navigation to be it sounds simple but then this actually sucks um it's basically like anywhere where you can stand somewhere but it's you can't see the sky from it but also you can't navigate to anything useful so we have like objective markers and like if you can't get to like a useful place then it's like maybe this is bad you still get a lot of false positives that way it's almost impossible to like perfect algorithmic algorithmically like where should there not nav mesh be that sounded like um here we go um just like auditing the navigation meshes like always that was a big thing oh here's a cool new gun pad I got the Stinger oh nice when I got the shield let's show that off red skate hey so this is again the best thing about making video games is you can just put whatever you want in them so this is a gun that shoots bees oh my God and it's uh oh this one has a perk where they'll like it's a little weird because this is the Hub world but they'll uh you can try and collect them and they'll like heal you um but they're like bees that will automatically home in on stuff um and then this is the this is another weapon that is probably the most divisive weapon in the game this is the sword and shield or what's it called the sliding Shield so it's got like a normal thing you can like combo Shield smack very fun uh but also the air attack and Sprint attacks are to do this but you can like uh right right try it again like go down that Hill there you go you like surf on the shield basically Kyle loves surfing and skateboarding although I don't know if you can either in real life but at least in video games you love them I used to skateboard I could kickflip that's as far as I got nice so a lot of people there's two types of people there's people that think the shield is the best weapon in the game and people think it's the worst weapon in the game um no in between no in between oh we can have fun now we can do a little gravity planet um low gravity with a surfing Shield it's gonna get pretty crazy so why why do people not like the shield I don't see because it's not uh well it makes you move around and maybe you don't want to and also like depending on how you play it doesn't have as much like damage it doesn't do as much damage at all yeah it doesn't do as much like PPS as like other weapons but it's like you can slide around and just like shoot while you use it it's the fastest way to move while shoot in the game normally when you're moving you like uh and um only when you're moving you move it like when you're aiming you move at a slower speed hmm and if you like running around fast and doing dumb stuff it's like the best well there I go another question we got oh you have the trash truck there you go yeah arguably one of the best parts um Sparky mcsparks is wondering if you can speak about Quest design and any custom solutions to quickly iterate on new objectives and encounters or also how you save a player progression um it depends what you mean by Quest we do have so objectives I'm assuming you mean like what you're actually doing in the level we do have a very rough like pseudoachievement system which are just these quests that the NPCs give you to just like incentivize doing different things that you might not normally do on your own and like exploring certain systems and you get like energy and and the Cosmetic rewards for that those aren't actually a central part of the game I kind of wish they were bigger but like you gotta launch at some point um but in terms of the actual uh and that's its whole thing in tracking achievements and stuff is a cool thing to explore but in terms of the actual objectives of what we're doing right now uh we really just have three kind of archetypes of missions for each level um a level being like when we eat this stuff and then everything turns beautiful and colorful and then we go to another place um and basically it's just I wouldn't say these are like the most creative it's just like what are things you can do that require you to use your like combat tool set so it's like go to a place destroy a thing um we don't we don't have anything sort of Beyond like go to a place stay in a place collect a thing destroy a thing um we have some interesting flavor on that so we have this like storm mode you might have seen where um it's like raining and the visibility is highly decreased so a lot of it is just like trying to find the objective by following lightning and things like that um so in terms of those objectives those are probably one of the simpler things in the game the way that we make it more complicated is like in this mode which is called Conquest objectives you have to destroy can have different properties so sometimes you get to an intro piece buyer and it has um eyes that can shoot you sometimes it becomes like a mini boss and you have to defeat the mini boss uh we have a couple other like surprising ones that are uh hopefully Pat will get one and we'll just experience it together that are much rarer um those are objectives talking about because I think there were three parts that were like encounters and save progression uh enemies are generated with this system that they're less than a ton of prior art for like usually for stuff in Game Dev you can kind of watch GVC talks for like oh how do you do Dynamic enemy encounters um and like we basically were faced with the challenge of like how do you turn like a difficulty number into an enemy encounter just through randomness uh we don't just have it's not like a A jrpg or something where you're loading in like there's five possible Encounters in this area um I don't know if they all do it that way but that's just my assumption um so we have this thing that I'd like to speak more on in like a technical talk at some point at like a conference but we have this like you basically have like a budget uh when you're like trying to prepare enemies for combat um and you have like a set like enemy catalog and then you just go on a shopping spree like you try and buy like randomly with this like budget that you have oh there we go that's what I was talking about Sauron I'm gonna stand here and try and not die um will the enemies like have set costs and my enemy groups have their own costs and we just like try and buy enemies and put them like in the game uh to try and we also have a thing that I think was first popularized and left for dead which is like an AI director that's sort of tracking how many enemies are trying to kill you at any given moment and uh based on this like sort of undulating graph of like how hard things should be depending on how long you've been playing or what you've just done um it will try and like meet that budget so it'll like it knows like what's killing you and then like tries to get there one thing I wanted to add is like from like one of my rules on the game is like all I kind of like try to balance everything and um you know kind of fine-tune the difficulty so one thing that we added is uh we started using curves like all over the place so like what Kai was talking about is like basically like uh we have it we call it like like the stress spawner so um everything is like on a curve so as like as your heat goes up like I can go in and I can fine tune that and like look at it like very visually and we found that like it's much easier to make sense of those things when like when they're a curve and you can kind of see it go up and down versus just like kind of imagining like the map in your head 100 big takeaways for procedural generation for us have been like make things as visual as you can and um make things give things as few knobs as you can so like yeah we have a lot of things that it's better to not have like extra health or boss per heat and like another thing that does sort of that like extra Eye Health or heat like those should try try making those like the same curve because like they're ultimately always going to go together anyway so anything that's correlated try and make that the same knob when I say knob I mean like a control like transform like the level you're on into like the difficulty to a real world value right like try and try and keep that simple because if you have 12 things to balance you're never gonna succeed ever it just it's uh a mere human cannot do that um we definitely got the point in the project probably a while back where we're like we don't remember like what everything does you know so yeah early on you're like oh I know where this thing is I know how to change that and then it's like oh I actually I forget I have to like figure out how to do that again and like so like Kyle was talking about like trying to make things smart for yourself so if you're gonna forget like where the knob is for that thing um so like reducing the layers of complexity can like help you like figure that out quite a bit I'm a little curious about if if you hold any kind of like documentation for yourselves about it as well or is it mostly open the project and kind of figure it out directly from there I think we could do a better job at documentation um we have we the things that we have very well documented are like a lot of the equipment and abilities but a lot of like the balancing knobs those are things that are like not as well documented that we've in Heinz to be like are not cynical it could be dated about it like I have been in a lot of jobs where the worst thing about documentation is like you have to it takes a lot of work to keep it up to date um yeah we have some things with equipment where we just have scripts that just like export uh like state of the game into like an Excel spreadsheet and that's great everything that has to be updated by hand will eventually be wrong um and like we had an issue recently where like we had an artist like making stuff for equipment that wasn't in the game anymore because we didn't update the spreadsheet so it's like potentially very expensive to try and like keep that stuff up to date um we have struggled this is our first like object with a very big not very big team but uh it's bigger than we've ever made and onboarding a new engineer mid project there are definitely some things with like having a game design document that is like simple and good and communicates what the game is supposed to be it's really useful when you're trying to onboard someone but it's actually I think kind of a hindrance potentially if you're just two people just kind of riffing um it becomes authoritative when it really shouldn't be but when you are bringing on new people it's very helpful and that's something we definitely are still working out how to do in terms of actual balance in numbers I personally I'm very much like the data is the source of Truth and whatever's in the game is how it works um that said I am a big fan of like documenting if you're ever trying to solve a problem the diary I have a big diary for the gameplay ability system I can show you right now but I won't because it probably has too many swear words in it um it's probably like 30 pages I have a similar one for getting multiplayer working on Xbox and all these other like for cert um I have my different like hell Diaries and it's so important to keep like links to the stack Overflow question that you used because you might not be able to find it quickly again um keep a diary of what you were trying to do highly recommend that I'm coming Pat oh my goodness it's no big deal like fly in the air yeah low gravity really makes the shield kind of um tough I forgot I forgot about that yeah we got him I was laughing at first when you said that your enemy design was from just your deepest darkest nightmares but I feel like the more of them I see the more I feel like you weren't joking about that it's kind of I was very inspired by um uh like I guess all of the 3D Zelda games where a lot of the enemies can be kind of cute and then the bosses are just like the worst most messed up thing you ever saw it's awful I do like that dichotomy a lot now yeah let's do it uh let me spend some of my skill points oh you want to spend some years maybe you should too you have uh 2 000 of them at then we won't embarrassingly die while fighting the boss if it happens it happens but I believe um let's see saibash here is wondering if you'd be open to talking a little bit about your epic Mega Grant experience kind of like at what point did you feel comfortable applying her one and and things like that yeah I I would say it's a fantastic question it's yeah I I think for us like we wanted to have like a prototype that we could share that we felt like communicated like the vision of our game so once we had that um and we also wanted to have like a trailer that people could just like watch and kind of get like an understanding like before they played it so once we had those two things is when we decided that we were like ready to apply for the maker Grant and um from there it took a little bit but then we heard back um and so yeah it was it was a really good experience yeah I know I don't know what the backlog is now it can take a decent amount of time is like the one thing I do try and tell people so you want to apply when you have something that you're you think will show well but you don't want to win until you're on like deep in production you don't want to wait until your game is like finished I mean you could but like it you know it's I think it's happening specifically you will probably have already figured out by the time you get it but they're not strict about that like if it's for development it's for development mm-hmm like we hired the person we needed the money to hire um but we had plenty of other things to do um so we're experiencing a cutscene right now they do work in multiplayer which is another Testament some cool stuff in Unreal Engine we didn't really have to do much to make that happen you can't see my screen but I see the same thing that's on the Stream do you see your character or do you see oh I see Patrick so this is a host character the host owns the universe even though we're both actually gaining heat same time mm-hmm with something the multiplayer model did actually change a little bit over the course like after release um we made it you used to not be able to you suggest be joining the other players world and like you got abilities and equipment and stuff but you weren't gaining story progress and now you do I love this character design so much I'm gonna stop Judy and him so we can look at it foreign this is probably my favorite like anime model and you can also tell from their moveset that uh we made this boss around when like Elden ring came out um sometimes sometimes that stuff really unavoidably like loots is the wrong word uh but here big shoe oh dang it I'm gonna die there's there's some uh oh there's no butterflies all right uh I'll take over Pat you can just I'll put out some uh vampires these little butterflies some of my health butterflies are Health some people don't think we're crazy they eat like bugs and stuff I think yeah yeah that sounds right it sounds right that's right right I feel like if you don't think about it too hard it it makes sense I think so all right actually I'm curious if anyone in chat knows if frogs do to eat butterflies specifically what is what is a typical Frog's diet if anyone knows I would I would love to hear it please enlighten us we have a question from attorney Cog and they're wondering if you put in any like memes or jokes in the game just for you or other devs oh that's interesting um like we did but I can't think of anything off the top of my head you think of anything called this guy into his next stage laughs all right I got so distracted because I what was it was just like I would say uh broken one of the uh the emotes the tipos emote yeah that's definitely something that I think other developers are going to be familiar with probably not um ERS as much but I think it depends what games you've been playing yeah if you played a lot of like steam or not steam um sorts engine games you are probably familiar with it that sounded like an insult it's not um he played like Gary's Mod you've seen that um other things uh most of the guys actually are like only made sense to the person who made them all of the dyes are references to things almost [Music] oh no who is this foreshadowing right there the drama that's actually the good guy and you're the bad guy I believe it oh my God I didn't know that until just now oh you have to sit through this really cool animation well I can just start playing oh you can just yeah there you go that's the one thing that doesn't replicate you also get a really good die for defeating that boss um I just want to plug a very cool plugin that we used on the project it is I think adds a lot Dragon ik if you're looking for like eat and like I ik Solutions and also like one thing we use it for is like enemies like looking at you which like we added this it's just like a very it's a very common thing in games but like Logan makes it really easy but just like when the NPCs like just kind of like crack where you're looking and also like the Frog kind of turns the way you're looking it just like adds a lot I think for for not a ton of effort turn completely around did I see that that's something that like would be cool I could probably do with the plug-in it might you might that the head might go like we should try that um we try and look into things like that actually like that but it should mentioned that yeah they can do that to be clear that's why that's why Tata said that is that they can't really that's what I will do crap man we failed we should have done that it's like 90 degrees it's pretty good I think it's pretty close yeah yeah it's almost there just got to push it a little further you went very quickly so it kind of looked like it just did which is why oh yeah it's maybe maybe it's something maybe it does there's a few things we always yeah what am I what am I thinking of um never mind don't listen to me don't listen to me everybody turn off your volume right now don't listen to Kyle that's what he says um there's another question here oh first also thank you Yoku they said that a frog diet consists of flies grubs and small bugs so very Zoological answer flies butterflies are flies it's in the name let's move on hold on hold on let's go back in that menu stay in that menu oh you love doing this hello amazing all right go ahead since the host owns the Universe um like how graceful are disconnects or um temporary like internet disruptions and stuff handled temporary internet connections are handled pretty well it's I we could definitely do more and if I were an expert at that instead of having to be an expert at literally everything in the game like um I'm sure we would signal better when there are connection problems I don't know if it's even in Vogue to have like a thing pop up when that happens but uh the connection stays up and unreal's system for this is very resilient and it'll keep trying for up to like a configurable amount I think for us it's like up to a minute uh if the host just shuts down or closes the game like there's no it doesn't move you and I wish it did it's a whole thing to set that up it's very very complicated if it was like a one day project we'd do it but I don't believe it is um and again because of like who owns the state of the world it is actually kind of complicated and you there are a lot of gameplay questions about who's hosting the game like how to set all that up um and if we but if we were if this were like uh a five person development like five person programming team instead of a two-person programming team I I think it would be something I'd love to do limited time and resources though yeah it's always what it is absolutely and for what it's worth most of the games I'd consider our peers have sort of that model um obviously things like Monster Hunter have had like 20 years to get that right and they do a spectacular job but there's a good news is you don't really lose a ton of progress if the host just quits because it's the levels that you're doing are sort of sectioned off medcard is wondering um what did you do for performance optimization specifically they're curious about animation and materials but I think just performance optimization in general is it's not the most exciting topic but it is sale like well no this is oh yeah I mean if you're a developer like I mean this is something that I am always trying to do um but like so speaking to the animations um a basic thing that we did was we uh back in like I forget what version of unreal it was but it was it was a period be period of time where it was not a way built into the engine where you could do skeletal mesh LEDs so you had to do it through like an exterior package and bring it in that has since been I think around for a while so we're like making heavy use of that which obviously is a pretty easy win the other thing that we're doing on the project which I didn't know about until maybe halfway in was I believe it's called update rate optimization which is basically basically what it does is it the distance from camera that a skeletal mesh is it will only update the animation blueprint like let's say every other frame or every five frames or like different increments and this is an automatic thing that you can enable you just click on your skeletal mesh and you go down to optimization and enable it and the thing it does which is really cool is it doesn't make it so it's just like skipping the frame so it looks all Steppy it has automatic smoothing on so like for most cases you're not even noticing it's doing it but for a game like ours where you have hundreds of enemies hundreds of like skeletal meshes on screen we definitely noticed like a very big performance boost when we enabled that um I think from like material perspective um I think it's just a lot of profiling and like utilizing like the quality switch node in like the material editor and uh we didn't really have too many like uh handicaps in terms of like you know materials that were costing us a lot that we had to like update or optimize a lot but just like utilizing like there's a very very huge exception to that uh which is the like light dark system oh that's that's true yeah one one thing that we have in the game uh where like like as you notice like when we run around there's like the transitions from light to dark we basically use um like sphere mass and like a material collection and we just like record the position in World space and then the radius so those get pumped into a lot of the different um shaders in the game and Kyle I'll let you I'll hand it over to you but we Kyle made this really cool thing where we used to have like maybe like 20 of those different like buckets that could be filled um but Kyle made a cool tool where like based on the camera's position it will like dynamically like utilize like a lot less of them which like reduced our yeah you think about for basically every every pixel that can be light or dark which is almost all of them I mean look at the landscape and the trees and stuff and this like like most people like they all know about that that material every single Pixel is having to check its distance from 20 different things which is surprisingly Works actually uh for a lot of Hardware um because graphics cards are amazing and uh but you know 20 is a lot it'd be great if we could get that down to like seven um so the way we did that is I do um frustrum calling um which is not any math that I understand but it's something I basically saw what the engine was doing and used a lot of that to write my own thing that does it where it will take all the Spheres of light and figure out which ones you can see and then rank them based on both their like priority so things that are static versus like a grenade exploding like a big landscape one is going to be our priority it's a priority and distance and use that to figure out which ones to draw and it's one of the least buggy things I've ever done um it worked right away I think we were kind of expecting it like after you wrote it we're like this is gonna be this is like constantly and it like worked perfectly the first like day two hours and it was like oh oh um meanwhile like making this grappling hook I'm using work took like two weeks um so that was that was the big visual optimization and then uh we talked about animations and unfortunately the in tandem with that is just like enemies in general is the big ended up being the big performance uh hog for us on most computers our game is game thread bound it's not GPU bound unless you're running it like above it's very rare to get through a case for the GPU it's slow unless you're running it like above 60 frames per second um or have I I don't know it's very mismatched Hardware um so the big thing is the default character class in unreal it does a lot of things that are not inefficient they're just expensive um so for a character to walk around it needs to like constantly be checking where the ground is what it's walking on uh what's in front of it it's like sweeping and that's basically happening every frame by default so for enemies and then for enemies to use like AI That's like another take every frame and a common thing is like ticks can really kill your performance in Unreal Engine um the main things we did to lessen the enemy stuff is to AI we don't take it every frame until it's like and did actually get used to open enemies far away it just kind of does whatever um and then oh an ultimate nice um the one thing that I just want to add on that is Kyle you made a thing where basically like the AI controller it will like dynamically set the tick rate based on how big the enemy is so like for example like something like that's really small like like our enemies we call them the imps they're like very teeny on screen you're not going to notice that that's ticking a lot less but something like a big boss that takes up a lot more of the screen that like we found this particularly every frame so that's like automatically so specifically character rotation is handled by the AI um there's ways to do it without using the AI but that's what we were doing so if a character wants to face you if it's a huge enemy even a slight reduction tick rate becomes extremely noticeable and there are other ways we could have solved that problem than just like taking it out of AI but we did um but the big thing is like enemies knowing where they're walking that is like the that is the mind killer um so the solution that we have for that and this won't work for every game but because uh enemies we noticed in profiling a lot of it a lot of the time was spent just finding the floor not moving the enemy itself so for finding the floor we added a cache so an enemy will just like only query for where the floor is every you know three times a second or something and that can also scale with how many enemies there are and that basically and there's a ton of enemies sometimes they'll sort of hover above ramps for a little longer than they should but if there's 100 enemies on screen you're not really going to notice that and the savings are just incredible for a game that's very has lots of different like non-landscapes to walk on like if everyone's using stairs and stuff that might be too noticeable so it really is a matter of what you can get away with there are a lot more optimizations we could do we just um a lot of them are based on like what enemies are on screen and because we have a multiplayer game with up to four cameras that are running over the network like that and it's hard to reason about we just got technology working to where we have a server knows what enemies are being seen by what players um so in the future after we moved to five we might try and optimize that a little more by reducing tick rates to things that people aren't looking at um that would be like a really obvious one but that's a lot of people's first move but for us because we don't really know the answer to that question 100 uh we were avoiding it fair enough doesn't see what I'm looking at and and we have to tell we have to tell the computer it doesn't just know you have to tell the computer but I don't wanna all right we're coming up a little bit closer to the end of time here um so I want to toss just a couple of Rapid Fire questions at you a couple more yeah um favorites and standout parts of the game so we talked about your favorite animations um what is your favorite feature or tool of the game with tool be like something that we use to create the game or like something you you play in the game I think in the game itself yeah um I mean I already gushed about the dumb like uh rainbow grind rail thing um I'm very proud of that uh that was like a thing I spent way too much time on just for me um go ahead no you go ahead I was just gonna say actually one of my favorite ones one of my favorite abilities I'll use it right now uh actually that I just killed them but we have a bubble ability so you can put enemies in bubbles this is like really fun here let me see if I can it's very fun you can also we'll see if I can get it to work there we go and on them it's very hard to do though with bigger enemies I'm never gonna be able to stand on one of these guys but just little things like that why can't you stand on the stuff but you know things it's it's like wouldn't it be cool if you try and do it like the remote control car is really fun for that reason do you also have a favorite um we'll go purely graphics for this one here but what's your favorite environment and favorite 3D probed it's a good question I will say my favorite environment is the last level of the game I think is really cool um there's a lot of like clouds and kind of like fake volumetric stuff going on in there um so I think that's that's probably my your environment favorite prop um that's a good question Kyle do you have a favorite prop it's not a prop I I'm just in love with the current armor set I'm wearing yeah actually I love I love mine too we just added these two chords I think so yeah some of the cores like I guess like armor sets like outfits um those I just think I love that Max are um designer did a really good job this like Paladin core I really like a lot actually that's probably my current favorite oh that's tight I have to use my ultimate I feel like I'm biased because I also love paladins where yeah it's a good class I think I think growing older you just appreciate paladins more I don't know yeah I grew up now it's like Paladin is like the reasonable it's what a responsible adult would be it's a paladin paladins feel like they just have everything together you know so maybe they can heal they can protect they're still strong that's all the things yeah yeah can you do that again nice yeah friendship see 10 and 10. we also this is a thing that I again I wish was like baked in a little more we do have ai players you can sometimes summon into levels with you right here which like I think if you're especially if you're playing single player we kind of give you like a little flavor of like what it is like to have like a little yeah these are Millennium out which is fun um yeah something I would love to to build out more it's just something we kind of had to do for like story purposes uh the storytellers the Giants used to be much bigger in scope and like Co-op was a specific it is kind of an in-world justification but we realized like having players beat the First Act to unlock unlock Co-op would kind of suck because you'd want to play co-op don't don't gate Co-op that's my uh my advice to anyone making a video game with multiplayer make it easy to use um so the AIS were usually a big part of that uh but now they're just kind of a fun extra thing and they also help us test the game you can have the game play itself and that was a really early way that we used to find major issues with the level generation is this like AI could do it it is actually really cool I wish we had done more with that and talked about it more just in our not just now but in our marketing because it is very neat we taught our game how to play itself follow for more is the game better at the game than you are though I think it might it's definitely better in spamming the emotes it's fair you made it very good at that Kyle so here's it right there Game Dev thing is that smiley face was never meant to be what that was but we just never changed it yeah oh yeah six weeks from release and you're like why doesn't multiplayer work in this circumstance you're never like we gotta fix the names characters like nope that's just going in I like it though got your good friend Smiley here with you we should at least make him like different emoticons one can be kind of angry when people giving you a little kiss all right what do we got ow so it's not truly random unless we get the same boss a couple times in the same playthrough there are I think how many bosses are there now Pat benatars I believe 13. oh my God so many more whoa whoa yeah it's Berserker so they do double damage my goodness oh you're right we might we might go down here oh I'm gonna die oh man the hand took us out that's our first one we call it there is that is that the Stream yeah actually we're kind of at time here but we plant we actually planned that just to die right there exactly yeah it was it was on purpose it was to show what happens if you die when you die exactly you die for real no planned I'll find out for sure honestly that was weirdly impeccably timed honestly oh but I have one final question for the two of you um what's one tip that you've learned during this Project's development that you would like for other developers to know really good question we talk about for this um beta beta right oh yeah so one thing I will say and this is something that I think you hear a lot um is you just want you want people to play your game you want to get player feedback so one you know we we did like you know we did packs and we showed the game like quite a bit but we had like more or less like an open beta and that was like very that's something I definitely recommend like everyone do like not it's also it's great from also a marketing like Community Building perspective but that um I don't know if you remember when we were talking about like the bugs and like actually the nav mesh but that's when we found out a lot of um a lot of things about the game like bugs like gameplay and uh is it was like incredibly valuable um the other thing and I was thinking about as we were talking about this earlier in addition to that is um there's things that sometimes like especially when you make like the more complex your game becomes sometimes you get in a spot where you're gonna have to like Embrace mistakes so there's a lot of like balancing in our game that happens so uh for example we basically like built like as you progress to the game the bosses get more and more challenging they get more Health we accidentally tied the boss Health to also the enemy health and we didn't like none of us like realized that so we like balanced with that happening but like not intentionally so once we discovered that we had to make the decision okay do we want to like rebalance everything and like rewrite all this stuff and potentially change the experience that we made that players have already had or do you just kind of want to embrace the mistake and just like know that we've already balanced with that in mind even though that wasn't Our intention so long story short I think also too like sometimes those mistakes that you make like you have to just think about okay is it really worth it for me to go back and fix this like am I fixing this for myself because I want the code to be perfect or is like this really going to make the player experience better so that's the circumstance where we just decided let's just embrace it let's just like let's keep it and like now we know that that's how it works yeah yeah worth noting for that also the game scales infinitely so this is impacting we have some real super fans that we were playing at heat I think like 1 000 you can there are people that eat a hundred thousand and so we like fixed that issue with the bosses and it's like wow now bosses are way too easy for people who have played the game more than we have um yeah so that's like another one of the challenges that's a big part of it too is like we wanted to make it like infinitely playable like scale upwards of however you much you want which is like a big challenge because like we can't test it at every different phase and every different difficulty because there's like infinite ones so we kind of have to like use our best like judgment and that's why the curves the difficulty curves come in big help so we can kind of at least like see a picture of it going up and anticipate where it's going to be yeah definitely well that's very good information to keep in mind I think for other developers especially if they're nearing a point in their game where it's it is possible to give it out get some more um a few more eyes on it some extra experience in there really helps kind of nail out some of those pesky bugs that like to hide away awesome well for anyone who has hung out in his watch and has enjoyed what they have seen where can they look for your game to get it for themselves so you can go to our website at playsog.com and that's going to have all the links to where it's out we're out on the Epic store right now and also Xbox awesome I'm very very exciting I mean I may or may not have bought it for myself right before this and I'm gonna be going through and enjoying my time with it later nice it's just it's too good there's no way I can't so thank you both so much for coming on today of course this was so much fun definitely it was so good and for anyone who's watching also thank you for being here and participating and asking questions show wouldn't be what it is without you and your interaction so really appreciate you taking the time to be here as well um if you missed any part of this stream beforehand no worries we post all of our streams of video format that can be viewed On Demand on both our twitch and YouTube channels at Unreal Engine you can also follow us on all social medias at Unreal Engine as well as if you're not already come join us over on the Epic developer community and in our forums we have tutorials we have places where you can connect with other developers you can find pretty much any information you would ever possibly need about the engine there so if you haven't already go check that out hang out it's a good time I promise I swear and yeah other than that thanks you all for being here and we'll see it next week for next week's Insight unreal and also another lfg on Friday the coming instead unreal I mean I always want you to come back anyway but this next one coming up we're actually going to be talking about um the newest release from epic online services that came out what day is it today's 18th two days ago released on the 16th so make sure you come check that out we got some really cool updates that we're excited to delve in with y'all but yeah other than that again one last big thank you to you Kyle and Patrick for coming on this was so much fun and we'll see the rest of you all later bye everyone bye bye [Music]
